<!-- Marketing Intro -->
<!-- Introducing "Leftover", a revolutionary app designed to connect local restaurants with individuals and organizations in need of food. With Leftover, restaurants can easily donate their surplus food from the day to people who are struggling to access nutritious meals.

Using Leftover is simple and convenient. Restaurants can create an account and list the type and quantity of food they have available for donation. This information is then shared with nearby shelters, food banks, and other organizations, who can arrange to pick up the food at a convenient time.

Individuals in need of food can also use the app to find local restaurants offering donations. They can search for nearby restaurants and view the available food items, making it easy to find a meal that fits their dietary needs.

Leftover is a win-win solution for restaurants and the community. Restaurants can reduce food waste, while providing much-needed nourishment to those who need it most. Meanwhile, individuals and organizations can receive high-quality food at no cost, reducing food insecurity and promoting better health outcomes.

Join the Leftover community today and help us make a difference in the fight against hunger. -->
